# Brain games

**Brain Games** is a set of five console-based games inspired by popular mobile apps designed to train your brain.  
Each game asks a series of questions that must be answered correctly.  

If you provide three correct answers in a row, you win the game.  
A wrong answer ends the game and prompts you to try again.
